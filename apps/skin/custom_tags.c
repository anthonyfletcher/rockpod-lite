 * RockPod-Lite

 * Original code from RockBox
 * was: apps/gui/skin_engine/custom_tags.c
 * This build's extra skin tags, kept out of lib/skin_parser/tag_table.c so
 * that file can track rockpod unchanged. find_tag() falls back to
 * find_custom_tag() (weak-linked there) when a tag isn't in the upstream
 * table.
 * GNU General Public License (version 2+)

 * Registry of this fork's non-upstream skin tags, kept separate so the
 * additions are visible in one place.
