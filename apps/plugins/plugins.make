#
# The plugin system has been removed from this fork. This file builds nothing.
#
# It survives only because tools/root.make:135 `include`s it by exact path, and
# a missing (non-optional) include is a fatal make error. tools/ is outside the
# scope this fork's cleanup is confined to, so the file stays.
#
# The credits.raw rule that used to live here moved to apps/apps.make -- it was
# never plugin-specific, and keeping it here tied it to ENABLEDPLUGINS=yes.
#
# See apps/plugins/README for the rest of this directory.
