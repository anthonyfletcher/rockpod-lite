 * The plugin system has been removed from this fork. All that remains of it in
 * the core is the RAM region a plugin used to run in (pluginbuf, from the
 * linker script), which a handful of core screens borrow as scratch space --
 * the bookmark list, cuesheet display, file copy/move, skin parsing, the
 * playlist viewer and the album art carousel.
 *
 * The rb-> API struct, the .rock loader and the rest of the plugin machinery
 * are all gone. The linker symbol and PLUGIN_BUFFER_SIZE keep their old names
 * because both live outside apps/.
 *
 * One buffer, one user. While the plugin system existed that held by
 * construction -- only one plugin ran at a time. It no longer does: several
 * core screens can be reached from one another, and two of them (the carousel
 * and the playlist viewer) hold the buffer for as long as their screen is up.
 * Nothing copies out of it, so an overlap silently aliases memory.
 *
 * Ownership is therefore tracked, but only for the holders that actually need
 * it. The long-lived pair claim and release around their screen's lifetime;
 * transient callers, which finish before returning to the UI loop, only assert
 * that nobody is holding it. That asymmetry is deliberate: a transient caller
 * cannot reliably release, because at least one of them (the bookmark list)
 * hands a pointer into this buffer back to *its* caller, so the region stays
 * live past the function that acquired it. Requiring a release there would
 * mean threading ownership through four unrelated call sites for no gain --
 * and a missed release would panic during ordinary use, which is a worse
 * failure than the one being prevented.
 * GNU General Public License (version 2+)
 *
 * Hands out the linker-reserved scratch buffer to whichever screen needs a
 * large temporary allocation, guarding against two owners at once.
