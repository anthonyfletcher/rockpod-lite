# The apps/ include path is owned here, deliberately, rather than by
# tools/configure's APPEXTRA variable. APPEXTRA was set to "recorder:gui:radio"
# for these targets, which is both stale (apps/radio/ was removed long ago) and
# harmful: putting apps/gui and apps/recorder on the search path let any file
# include "splash.h" or "bmp.h" and get a header from a directory it never
# named. Includes are now written relative to apps/ ("gui/splash.h"), so the
# path needs only apps/ itself.
#
# apps/api comes first: it holds forwarding stubs for the handful of apps/
# headers that firmware/ and lib/ include by bare name. Listing it first means
# the build exercises those stubs, so a broken one fails here rather than in a
# later refactor. See apps/api/README.

# apps/features.txt is a file that (is preprocessed and) lists named features
# based on defines in the config-*.h files. The named features will be passed
# to genlang and thus (translated) phrases can be used based on those names.
# button.h is included for the HAS_BUTTON_HOLD define.
#
# Kludge: depends on config.o which only depends on config-*.h to have config.h
# changes trigger a genlang re-run
